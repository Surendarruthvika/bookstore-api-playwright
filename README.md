# üìö Bookstore API Test Automation with Playwright

This project provides a complete test automation suite for a Bookstore API using **Playwright** with integrated **FastAPI** backend, **JWT authentication**, and **Allure reporting**.

---

## üöÄ Features

- FastAPI server with in-memory user and book management
- JWT-based user authentication
- Full CRUD tests for books
- Positive and negative test coverage
- Request chaining across test steps
- Allure reporting integration
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline ready
- `.env` support for environment config

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python (FastAPI)
- Node.js (Playwright)
- Playwright Test Runner
- Allure Reporter
- dotenv
- GitHub Actions

## üß∞ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git https://github.com/Surendarruthvika/bookstore-api-playwright.git
cd bookstore-api-playwright
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

> If Python dependencies are needed, set up your Python environment and install FastAPI, Uvicorn, and others:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt  # If provided
```

### 3. Start the FastAPI Server

```bash
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This runs the API on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 4. Run the Tests
# Open new terminal without closing the previous terminal
```bash
npx playwright test
```

### 5. Generate Allure Report

```bash
npx playwright test --reporter=allure-playwright
npx allure serve
```

---

## üîê Authentication

The app uses **OAuth2 with JWT tokens**. Token-based auth is required for protected routes. To test:

- Register a user via the `/register` endpoint
- Log in via `/login` to obtain a JWT token
- Use that token in headers: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

## üì¶ 2nd Way of Project Setup & Usage Guide

### üß∞ Installation

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Install Playwright browsers:
   ```bash
   npx playwright install --with-deps
   ```

---

### üöÄ Running the API & Tests

#### Option 1: Run API and Playwright Tests Together
```bash
npm run test:all
```

This script:
- Starts the FastAPI server (`uvicorn`)
- Waits for it to be available
- Runs all Playwright API tests

#### Option 2: Run Separately (Manual Two-Terminal Workflow)

**Terminal 1 ‚Äì Start the API:**
```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
```

**Terminal 2 ‚Äì Run tests:**
```bash
npx playwright test
```

---

### üìä Generating Allure Report

1. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm run test:all
   ```

2. Generate and open the report:
   ```bash
   npm run report
   ```

> Ensure `allure` is installed on your system. If not, install via:
> ```bash
> npm install -g allure-commandline --save-dev
> ```

### üìÇ Scripts in `package.json`

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "python3 main.py",
  "test": "playwright test",
  "report": "allure generate allure-results --clean && allure open",
  "test:all": "concurrently \"python -m uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000\" \"wait-on http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs && npx playwright test\""
}
```
